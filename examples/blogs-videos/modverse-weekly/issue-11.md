# ModVerse Weekly - Issue 11

## Introduction üì∞

Welcome to Issue 11!

ModCon is less than one week away, and we've been crunching to land some extra
features for `mojo v0.6.0` in preparation for the demos. The team is very
excited to share what we've built!

Due to overwhelming demand and selling out tickets, we decided to livestream the
keynote so that everyone can enjoy the announcements together. The videos from
the smaller lightning talks will be released to YouTube at a later date. Chat
will be disabled on YouTube so make sure to join the Discord where everyone will
be hanging out in the `#modcon` channel.
